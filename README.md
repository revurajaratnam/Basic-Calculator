⭐ Basic OOP Console Calculator
This project is a simple command-line calculator built in Java. Its primary purpose is to showcase fundamental Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and demonstrate robust application structure and exception handling.

⚙️ Technologies Used
Language: Java

Concepts Demonstrated:

Interface (Calculator): Defining a contract for required functionality.

Implementation (SimpleCalculator): Providing the concrete logic for the interface methods.

Composition (Main Class): Using the SimpleCalculator instance rather than inheriting from it, adhering to the "favor composition over inheritance" principle.

Exception Handling: Gracefully handling runtime errors, specifically preventing application crashes on division by zero using ArithmeticException.
